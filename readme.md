# server-load-testing
testing speed of back-end servers and languages that are compatible with REST API

## how to test
Install the packages from the package.json    
You can only start one server at a time   
You will probably need to install Flask with pip install Flask, or pip3 install Flask on mac
Add a back-end server if you want, the front-end hits port 5000   
in loadTest.js at the bottom change the file you want to write to
